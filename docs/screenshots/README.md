# Screenshots

Add screenshots of the working system here. Suggested files:

- **issuance-page.png** – Issuance page with a successful credential request (token shown).
- **verification-page.png** – Verification page with a successful token verification (record + worker ID).
- **services-running.png** – `docker ps` or `kubectl get pods` showing all services running.

Then reference them in the main [README.md](../../README.md) under "Screenshots of Working System".
